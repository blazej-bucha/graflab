# GrafLab

GrafLab (GRAvity Field LABoratory) is a MATLAB-based routine to compute
functionals of the geopotential up to high degrees (tens of thousands and
beyond).


## Features:

* Evaluates 38 functionals of the geopotential (e.g., the geoid, height
  anomaly, gravity anomalies/disturbances, deflections of the vertical,
  gravitational tensor).

* Evaluates the commission error of 26 functionals using a full
  variance-covariance matrix of spherical harmonic coefficients.

* Supports efficient FFT-based synthesis at grids and point-by-point synthesis
  at scattered points.

* Reads models in the [gfc](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM-Format-2011.pdf)
  format defined by [ICGEM](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de).

* Works with evaluation points defined by spherical as well as ellipsoidal
  coordinates.

* Plots output data on a map.

Users can interact with GrafLab either through a GUI (the figure below) or from
the command line.

# Disclaimer

GrafLab is an old project that breaks almost all of the best practices in terms
of coding and documenting standards. Nonetheless, the package seems to work
correctly, it has been thoroughly tested and the computation speed is
reasonable (as far as it is possible in MATLAB). Hoping it might still be
useful to others, GrafLab remains being publicly available.
