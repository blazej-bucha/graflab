===============================================================================

March 2020 (GrafLab 2.1.4)

- Fixed a bug when loading evaluation points from a data file, using the
  GUI and the data file is stored in a different folder than the source
  code of GrafLab. The bug was introduced in the previous version of 
  GrafLab (2.1.3).

===============================================================================

November 2019 (GrafLab 2.1.3)

Series of minor updates.

- Fixed a bug when computing the disturbing or the gravitational tensor
  in LNOF and the nmax value is set to 2 (GrafLab did not start the computation
  due to an error).

- When the input spherical harmonic model follows the structure defined by 
  ICGEM and its suffix is "gfc", GrafLab from its very first version uses the 
  values of the geocentric gravitational constant (GM) and the radius of the 
  reference sphere (R) from the header of that file. If these two values, 
  entered either via the GUI or the batch mode, are different from that in the 
  "gfc" file, GrafLab now throws a warning, saying that it will use the values 
  from the "gfc" file. If one is not sure which values were actually used in 
  the computation, note that the report file provides always the values used in 
  the computation.

- The lightning-fast plotting via the imagesc function is now available also
  from the GUI. This option does not require Mapping Toolbox.

- In the GUI, the font has been changed from Cambria to Helvetica, 
  as the latter one can commonly be found under various operating systems.

- The GUI now shows the entered name of the output file as well as of the
  input file for the "Load data" computation mode.

- The main window with GUI is wider, so that the pop-up menus showing the name 
  of functionals are better readable under Linux.

- Some rather uncommon symbols in the GUI were changed (e.g., the symbol for 
  spatial degrees was changed to "deg", etc.), so that the GUI displays now 
  correctly under Linux as well.

- The version of MATLAB used to perform the computation was added to the report 
  file.

- In order to provide nicer maps, GrafLab now chooses the upper and lower 
  limits of the colorbar based on the standard deviation of the data (from 
  -4*STD to 4*STD) and not necessarily based on the min and max values of the 
  data.

- In the report file, GrafLab now gives the correct name of the computer 
  (hostname) when running under Linux.

===============================================================================

April 2019 (GrafLab 2.1.2)

Minor updates. Thanks to my students, who noticed some of the errors that 
follow.

- Fixed an error when running GrafLab via the batch mode and setting
  the variable "Status_bar" to 0 (the computation did not start).

- Added error messages when any of the input files does not exist (GGM file,
  DTM file, data point file).

===============================================================================

December 2018 (GrafLab 2.1.1)

Minor updates.

- GrafLab can now automatically take the maximum degree from the geopotential 
  model and use it in the synthesis also in the batch mode. This can be 
  achieved by setting the input parameter "nmax" to the string 'nmaxGGM' (see 
  the description of the input parameters in the source code).

- Fixed an error message that has been introduced in the previous version (typo 
  in the description of the error; related to the diagonal components of the 
  tensors in LNOF).

- Uploaded new "EGM96.mat" file with the structure that can be read by GrafLab 
  2.1.0 and later.

===============================================================================

October 2018 (GrafLab 2.1.0)

Moderate updates focused mostly on improving large-scale computations up to 
ultra-high harmonic degrees (well beyond 10800).

- GrafLab now takes advantage of the equatorial symmetry property of Legendre 
  functions.  This rule provides a mutual relation between Legendre functions 
  for the southern and the northern hemisphere. It is beneficial in case of 
  large-scale grids that are symmetric with respect to the equator, 
  necessitating to compute Legendre functions only for one hemisphere (Legendre 
  functions for the other hemisphere are derived by means of this rule).

  The new version of GrafLab exploits the symmetry property if *each* of the 
  following conditions is satisfied:

    1) A functional of the geopotential is to be computed (the computation of 
       commission errors does not exploit the symmetry property).

    2) The grid-wise computation mode is selected.

    3) The extended-range arithmetic approach is selected to compute Legendre 
       functions (the whole improvement is tailored to ultra-high harmonic 
       degrees for which the standard and modified forward column approaches 
       for Legendre functions do not provide accurate results anyway).

    4) All positive latitudes have their negative counterpart or vice versa (up 
       to a given threshold to suppress numerical inaccuracies, currently 
       100*eps degrees). The zero latitude, i.e., the equator, may be included 
       in the grid (again, within the 100*eps deg numerical threshold).

  If all these conditions are satisfied, the symmetry property is employed 
  *automatically*, meaning that no additional action from the user is required 
  to enable the more efficient variant.

  The gain in the computational speed when synthesising the disturbing 
  potential is summarized for a few variants below:


      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Global equiangular         | Maximum degree   | Improvement of the new
      grid (grid size            | of the expansion | version in terms of the 
      as lats x longs)           |                  | computation time
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      30 arcmin (361 x 721)      | 360              | 1.3 times faster
      5 arcmin  (2161 x 4321)    | 2160             | 1.5 times faster
      1 armin   (10801 x 21601)  | 10800            | 1.5 times faster
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Examples of some symmetric grids (shown are only the latitudes):
           lat = [-90 -60 -30 0 30 60 90]; %Equator included
           lat = [-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80]; %Equator included
           lat = [-35 -25 -15 -5 5 15 25 35]; %Equator excluded
           lat = [-90 -85 -80 80 85 90];
           lat = [-90 -80 -75 -70 -69 -68 -67 -66 -65 65 66 67 68 69 70 75 80 90]; %Varying spacing

  Examples of some grids that are not considered as symmetric (shown are only latitudes):
           lat = [-90 -60 -30 0 30 60]; %The negative latitude of -90 deg does not have its positive counterpart
           lat = [-35 -25 -15 -4.99 5 15 25 35]; %The difference "abs(abs(-4.99)-5)" is larger than the threshold of 100*eps degrees

  Note that the four aforementioned conditions imply that the symmetry property 
  can be employed also when the grid is split into several latitude bands. This 
  is beneficial when the grid is too large and there is not enough available 
  RAM for GrafLab (e.g., when GrafLab is called inside a parfor loop and the 
  computation is performed on a cluster). The symmetry property can be 
  exploited even if the latitudes of the individual bands are specified in the 
  following manner: e.g., fi = [-90:1:-80 80:1:90];

- GrafLab is now able to perform the harmonic synthesis even if the minimum 
  degree of the imported coefficients set is larger than 2. For instance, the 
  input file may contain coefficients only from the harmonic band 
  2161,...,10800 or some other.  This is beneficial when the set of spherical 
  harmonic coefficients is too large to fit into RAM. For instance, 
  coefficients of a degree-43200 expansion require ~30 GB RAM to store them 
  (the file has 4 columns: degree, order, Cnm, Snm). In such cases, it can be 
  useful to split the coefficients set into several smaller subsets, such that 
  each subset can be stored in RAM. For instance, a single coefficients set of 
  a degree-43,200 expansion can be split into the following harmonic bands: 
  0,...,2160; 2161,...,4320;...; 38881,...43200. Then, the computation is 
  performed for each harmonic band separately and the results are summed (if 
  this is permissible for the particular functional). Note that such 
  computation involves many redundant evaluations of Legendre 
  functions. Therefore, it is not optimized efficiently, but at least it can be 
  performed.

  Example: A file with an incomplete set of spherical harmonic coefficients can 
           be obtained from the enclosed gravity field model EGM96 (the 
           "EGM96.mat" file) using the following commands:

           load('EGM96.mat'); %Loads EGM96, a gravity model up to degree 360
           EGM96(EGM96(:,1)<100,:)=[]; %Deletes coefficients below degree 100
           save EGM96_nmin100_nmax360.mat -mat -v7.3 EGM96 %Saves the harmonic band 100,...360 of the EGM96 model

           The file "EGM96_nmin100_nmax360.mat" can subsequently be imported 
           into GrafLab.

- The new version of GrafLab does not require to specify degrees and orders of 
  spherical harmonic coefficients if sorted as in Table 1 (see below).

           Table 1: Structure of the input GGM file - spherical harmonic 
           coefficients sorted primarily according to degrees.
           ----------------------------------------
           n   m       Cnm           Snm
           ----------------------------------------
           2   0   -0.48417E-03    0.00000E+00
           2   1   -0.20662E-09    0.13844E-08
           2   2    0.24394E-05   -0.14003E-05
           3   0    0.95716E-06    0.00000E+00
           ----------------------------------------

  To employ this functionality, the input file must be in the binary "*.mat" 
  format and must contain three variables:

    1) a matrix of an arbitrary name (following the Matlab's rules) with two 
       columns ([Cnm Snm], cf.  the third and fourth column in Table 1),

    2) an integer named as "nmin" specifying the minimum degree of the 
       coefficients to be imported,

    3) an integer names as "nmax" specifying the maximum degree of the 
       coefficients to be imported.

  Again, this improvement is aimed for a more comfortable handling of 
  ultra-high-degree expansions, for which the size of the input files 
  containing spherical harmonic coefficients may easily reach a few tens of GB 
  on the disk.  Omitting the first two columns from Table 1 reduces the size of 
  the input file by about one half.  Importantly, the first two columns from 
  Table 1 may be omitted only if the coefficients are sorted as shown in Table 
  1. Other orderings of the coefficients, such as the one in Table 2 or others, 
  are not supported in this case.

           Table 2: Structure of the input GGM file - spherical harmonic 
           coefficients sorted primarily according to orders.
           ----------------------------------------
           n   m       Cnm           Snm
           ----------------------------------------
           2   0   -0.48417E-03    0.00000E+00
           3   0    0.95712E-06    0.00000E+00
           4   0    0.53998E-06    0.00000E+00
           5   0    0.68658E-07    0.00000E+00
           ----------------------------------------

  Note that if the degrees and orders are omitted in the file, GrafLab does not 
  perform checks of the structure of the file.

  Example: A file with an incomplete set of spherical harmonic coefficients 
           excluding information on degrees and orders can be obtained from the 
           enclosed gravity field model EGM96 (the "EGM96.mat" file) using the 
           following commands:

           load('EGM96.mat'); %Loads EGM96, a gravity model up to degree 360
                              %Importantly, the coefficients in this file are stored in agreement with Table 1.
                              %No reordering of the coefficients is therefore necessary.
           EGM96(EGM96(:,1)<100,:)=[]; %Deletes coefficients below degree 100
           EGM96(:,1:2)=[]; %Deletes information on degrees and orders
           nmin=100; %Specifies the minimum degree of the coefficients
           nmax=360; %Specifies the maximum degree of the coefficients
           save EGM96_NoDegreesOrders_nmin100_nmax360.mat -mat -v7.3 EGM96 nmin nmax %Saves the harmonic band 100,...360 of the EGM96 model and variables nmin and nmax

           The file "EGM96_NoDegreesOrders_nmin100_nmax360.mat" can 
           subsequently be imported into GrafLab.

- Data computed via the grid-wise mode can now be displayed even without the 
  Mapping Toolbox. This is possible only when working without the GUI and the 
  variable "Display_data" is set to 2 (cf. the description of the input 
  variables to the "GrafLab" function).  The data are plotted simply as 
  a matrix using the "imagesc" function. On the one hand, the plots are not as 
  pretty as in the case of the Mapping Toolbox, but, on the other hand, the 
  processing time is reduced substantially.  This improvement is therefore 
  suitable for plotting large grids, say, with millions of points.

  Example: Using the enclosed EGM96 gravity model, the plots with and without 
           the Mapping Toolbox can be obtained using the following commands 
           (compute the disturbing potential):

           tic
           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,1,'EGM96.mat',0,0,-90,0.5,90,0,0.5,360,0,[],[],[],[],'Mapping_Toolbox',0,5,1,[],1,1,0,1,6,1,50,300,1)
           toc
           tic
           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,1,'EGM96.mat',0,0,-90,0.5,90,0,0.5,360,0,[],[],[],[],'No_Mapping_Toolbox',0,5,1,[],1,1,0,2,6,1,50,300,1)
           toc

           Here, the case when Mapping Toolbox is not used is 13 times faster 
           (the time that is needed for the synthesis is negligible here).  
           Even more impressive improvement is obtained when the grid is larger 
           and/or a functional that strongly varies is to be displayed. For 
           instance, the "imagesc" function (that is, not using Mapping 
           Toolbox) is 450 times faster when the gravity disturbances are 
           computed using the previous example:

           tic
           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,1,'EGM96.mat',0,0,-90,0.5,90,0,0.5,360,0,[],[],[],[],'Mapping_Toolbox',0,21,1,[],1,1,0,1,6,1,50,300,1)
           toc
           tic
           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,1,'EGM96.mat',0,0,-90,0.5,90,0,0.5,360,0,[],[],[],[],'No_Mapping_Toolbox',0,21,1,[],1,1,0,2,6,1,50,300,1)
           toc

- The numerical outputs from GrafLab can now be taken directly as the output 
  from the function "GrafLab".  The structure of the output variable is the 
  same as in case of the output files.

- Improved reading of the "gfc" files header.

===============================================================================

September 2017 (GrafLab 2.0.1)

Minor updates.

- Improved reading of the "gfc" files header.  The earlier versions of GrafLab 
  were not able to read "gfc" format for some models, such as GECO, that 
  contain in the header of the files physical units after the values of 
  "earth_gravity_constant" and "radius".  GrafLab now also checks the 
  normalization of the spherical harmonic coefficients (only the 
  "fully_normalized" option is supported).

- An additional error check added when computing "Geoid_undulation" or 
  "Height_anomaly".  GrafLab now verifies whether the maximum degree of the DTM 
  is sufficiently large compared with the maximum degree used to compute the 
  two functionals from a geopotential model.

- A minor modification in the report file.

===============================================================================

January 2017 (GrafLab 2.0)

This is a major update of GrafLab.

- GrafLab can now be fully controlled without the GUI.  The test computation 
  (see the file "user_manual_GrafLab.txt", section "Test computation of 
  a functional of the geopotential") can be run using the following command:

           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,1,'EGM96.mat',0,1,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],'input.txt',[],[],[],'my_output',0,5,1,[],1,1,0,[],[],[],[],[],1)

  The description of the input variables can be found in the source code (look 
  for the text: "function GrafLab")

- The functional "Gravity" has been replaced by a new one, which is named 
  "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ".  The functional "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ" yields 
  three elements of the gravity vector in the LNOF, while the original 
  functional "Gravity" was defined as the magnitude of the gravity vector.  
  "Gravity" can easily be computed from "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ" via 
  sqrt(gX^2+gY^2+gZ^2).  For the definition of this functional, see 
  "Definition_of_functionals_of_the_geopotential_used_in_GrafLab_software.pdf".

- When working without the GUI, a custom reference ellipsoid can now be defined 
  by 5 parameters: geocentric gravitational constant, semimajor axis, the first 
  numerical eccentricity, the 4*pi fully normalized spherical harmonic 
  coefficient C20 and the angular velocity.  This option is not available via 
  the GUI.

- Grid-wise computations can now be performed on user-specified grids defined 
  by vectors of latitudes and longitudes. Within each of the two vectors, 
  varying spacing is supported.

- Functions to transform ellipsoidal/spherical coordinates into cartesian ones 
  and vice versa have been replaced by own functions in order to remove the 
  dependency of the computation part of the code on the Mapping Toolbox. To 
  display data on a map, Mapping Toolbox is still required.  The new functions 
  can be found at the end of the source code.

           Original function   <-->   New function
           geodetic2ecef       <-->   ell2cart
           ecef2geodetic       <-->   cart2ell
           sph2cart            <-->   sph2cart (the same name, but the new function is used)
           cart2sph            <-->   cart2sph (the same name, but the new function is used)

  The input and output parameters of the matching functions remain the same.

- The version 7.3 of the Matlab's binary file format is now used by default to 
  save the computed data into a MAT-file. This version allows to save data 
  greater than 2 GB on 64-bit systems.

- Minor modifications of the report file.

- Some error checks are added or slightly modified.

Some useful tips and tricks:

- Example No. 1:

  To compute gravitational vector in the LNOF (i.e. the gravity vector without 
  the centrifugal part), choose the functional "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ" and 
  use a custom reference ellipsoid with the angular velocity being equal to 
  zero:

           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,[3986005*10^8 6378137 sqrt(0.006694380022903416) -108263*10^-8/sqrt(5) 0],'EGM96.mat',0,1,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],'input.txt',[],[],[],'Example_1',0,16,1,[],1,1,0,[],[],[],[],[],1)

  Here, the GRS80 reference ellipsoid is used (look for "%GRS80" in the source 
  code to obtain the 5 defining parameters) with the angular velocity set to 
  zero. Note that even though the functional "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ" is 
  independent of the reference ellipsoid and of its normal gravity field, it 
  has to be defined for two reasons: 1) in all computations, GrafLab takes the 
  value of the angular velocity from the defining parameters of the reference 
  ellipsoid, since global gravity field models usually do not specify this 
  parameter; 2) GrafLab needs the values of the semimajor axis and of the first 
  numerical eccentricity if the input coordinates are ellipsoidal (which is the 
  case of the aforementioned example).  The ellipsoidal coordinates have to be 
  to transformed into spherical ones, which are then used to perform spherical 
  harmonic synthesis; hence the values of the semimajor axis and of the first 
  numerical eccentricity are required for the transformation step. In the case 
  of computational points defined by spherical coordinates, all 5 defining 
  parameters can be set to zero, as they are not used in the computation.

  Note, however, that in the report file, the name of the functional 
  "Gravity_vector_gX_gY_gZ" will appear, not "Gravitational_vector_gX_gY_gZ".

- Example No. 2:

  If you wish to compute some functional that originally employs the normal 
  gravity field of a reference ellipsoid (e.g. the gravity disturbance in 
  spherical approximation -- "Gravity_disturbance_sa"), but without the normal 
  gravity field, set the parameters GM, C20 and omega to zero:

           GrafLab('OK',3986004.415E+8,6378136.3,0,360,[0 6378137 sqrt(0.006694380022903416) 0 0],'EGM96.mat',0,1,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],'input.txt',[],[],[],'Example_2',0,21,1,[],1,1,0,[],[],[],[],[],1)

  In this case, we obtained the negative first-order radial derivative of the 
  gravitational potential. Again, the values of the semimajor axis and of the 
  first eccentricity of the reference ellipsoid are required, as the 
  computation points are defined by ellipsoidal coordinates and have to be 
  transformed into spherical ones.

  Note that in the report file, the name of the functional 
  "Gravity_disturbance_sa" will appear.

- Example No. 3:

  GrafLab can also be used to perform a surface spherical synthesis without the 
  scaling parameters "GM" and "R". This is especially useful when one needs to 
  compute, e.g., a planetary topography expanded in a series of surface 
  spherical harmonics.

  The following command computes the Earth's topography from a DTM2006.0 model 
  (the enclosed "DTM2006.mat" file) to degree and order 360 on a global grid:

           GrafLab('OK',1,1,0,360,[0 0 0 0 0],'DTM2006.mat',1,0,-90,1,90,0,1,360,0,[],[],[],[],'Example_3',0,11,1,[],1,1,0,[],[],[],[],[],1)

  In this example, we defined the computation points by spherical coordinates 
  (as the computation has to be performed on a sphere), set the "GM" and "R" 
  values to one and computed the functional "Gravitational_potential". With 
  these settings, we performed a surface spherical harmonic synthesis, 
  obtaining the Earth's topography expanded up to degree 360 from the DTM2006.0 
  model.

  Similarly as in the previous examples, the name of the functional 
  "Gravitational_potential" will appear in the report file.

- Example No. 4:

  GrafLab now allows to perform a fast spherical harmonic synthesis on grids 
  defined by varying spacing in the latitudinal and/or the longitudinal 
  directions. 

  This option can be used, e.g., to perform synthesis on a grid defined in 
  ellipsoidal coordinates, but with equal spacing of the latitudes in terms of 
  spherical coordinates. Suppose that we wish to compute some functional on 
  a grid lying on a reference ellipsoid with equal spacing in spherical 
  latitude (i.e., the spacing in terms of ellipsoidal latitudes varies). The 
  grid is defined by the spherical latitudes "phi_sph=-90:1:90", the longitudes 
  "lambda=0:1:360" and the height of the grid above the reference ellipsoid 
  "h=0". The spherical latitudes "phi_sph" can be transformed into ellipsoidal 
  ones "phi_ell", and these ellipsoidal latitudes (with varying spacing) can 
  now be used as the input ellipsoidal coordinates. Example commands:

           phi_sph=[-90:1:90]'; %Vector of spherical latitudes

  These commands compute the disturbing potential from EGM96 up to degree and 
  order 360 on a grid referring to the GRS80 ellipsoid.  The grid is 
  equiangular in spherical coordinates (the step in the both the latitudinal 
  and the longitudinal direction is 1°), but is non-equiangular in terms of 
  ellipsoidal latitudes, as the spacing in ellipsoidal latitudes varies.

November 2016 (GrafLab 1.2.3)

- Until this version, the accelerated routine to compute the fully normalized 
  associated Legendre functions using the extended-range arithmetic approach on 
  64-bit Matlab (see the modification from August 2015) was implemented only to 
  the grid computations.  The improved routine is now also implemented in the 
  point-wise computation and the load data option.

===============================================================================

April 2016 (GrafLab 1.2.2)

- Minor modifications to ensure compatibility with the latest releases of 
  Matlab.

===============================================================================

August 2015 (GrafLab 1.2.1)

- Accelerated routine to compute the fully normalized associated Legendre 
  functions via the extended-range arithmetic approach on 64-bit Matlab. For 
  example, for "nmax=2190" and 1801 latitudes, the new routine is approximately 
  two times faster then the previous one. The routine for 32-bit Matlab remains 
  the same.

===============================================================================

April 2014 (GrafLab 1.2)

- The earlier versions of GrafLab automatically assumed that the spherical 
  harmonic coefficients of the degrees 0 and 1 are set as follows: "C00=1", 
  "C10=0", "C11=0" and "S11=0". There is no such a restriction in the new 
  version 1.2. This means that, for example, spherical harmonic coefficients of 
  the potential of topographic masses can now be imported and used with "nmin 
  = 0" (instead of "nmin = 2" as in the previous versions of GrafLab). In 
  general, in the case of the potential of topographic masses, these 
  coefficietns have different values from the ones stated above.  Thereby, the 
  following functionals must be computed with "nmin = 0": "Geoid undulation", 
  "Height anomaly", "Gravity disturbance", and the non-diagonal elements of the 
  disturbing and the gravitational tensor in the LNOF. The rest of the 
  functionals can be computed with a value of nmin in the interval "0 <= nmin 
  <= nmax". For a detailed overview, please, see Table 4 in the source code 
  "GrafLab.m".  If the GGM file does not specify any of these coefficients, 
  GrafLab will automatically use the aforementioned values for the unspecified 
  coefficients.  As for the computation of commission errors, neither the 
  structure of the variance-covariance matrix nor the value of "nmin" are 
  changed compared to the version 1.00.

- GrafLab 1.2 computes the zonal spherical harmonic coefficients of the 
  reference ellipsoid up to degree "n = 20" (in the previous versions this 
  value was set to "n = 10" which is sufficient in the vast majority of 
  practical applications).  The differences compared to "n = 10" are of very 
  small orders of magnitude, although might be noticeable in the results 
  provided by GrafLab. For example, the differences in terms of the disturbing 
  potential are approximately of the order of 10^-8 m^2*s^-2 or so.

===============================================================================

February 2014 (GrafLab 1.1.2)

- A bug was detected when computing the functionals "Geoid undulation" and 
  "Height anomaly" using spherical harmonic coefficients sorted primarily 
  according to orders. Fixed.

===============================================================================

November 2013 (GrafLab 1.1.1)

- The sign "~" in the commands such as "[fi, ~, h]=ecef2geodetic(X,Y,Z,[aEl 
  eEl]')" might cause an error in some older versions of MATLAB. Fixed.

===============================================================================

August 2013 (GrafLab 1.10)

- Functionals of disturbing potential can now be computed including the 
  zero-degree term "DELTA C00 = 1 - GMEll/GM" (if "nmin = 0"). In general, this 
  term should be included in the computation, since otherwise it causes a shift 
  in magnitude. If you do not wish to use this term, please set "nmin = 2".  
  This change affects the following functionals of disturbing potential: 
  disturbing potential "T", gravity disturbance sa (spherical approximation) 
  "delta g_sa", gravity anomaly sa (spherical approximation) "DELTA g_sa", 
  second radial derivative of disturbing potential "T_rr", diagonal elements of 
  disturbing tensor in the LNOF "T_xx, T_yy, T_zz", geoid undulation "N", 
  height anomaly ell "zeta_ell", height anomaly "zeta".

- A bug was detected when computing gravity disturbance "delta g" using the 
  point-wise approach (or load data) and "nmax < 10". MATLAB displayed an error 
  message: "Attempted to access CElm(X); index out of bounds because 
  numel(CElm)=X-1". Fixed.

- The gravity disturbance "delta g" cannot be now computed if "nmin > 0".

- If the GGM file has the structure defined by ICGEM (note that the name of the 
  input file must have the suffix ".gfc"), GrafLab now uses the values of "GM" 
  and "R" from this file, and ignores the values of these two variables entered 
  via the GUI.

- In addition to the ASCII file, the binary MAT-file can now be used to import 
  the computational points using the check-box "Load data". Its name appears in 
  the report file.

- In some versions of MATLAB and Mapping toolbox, the colorbar in displayed 
  figures may wrongly vary from 0 to 1. This issue was fixed using the function 
  "caxis".
